# Reserve-Me-A-Doctor-backend📖 <a name="about-project"></a>

**Reserve-Me-A-Doctor-backend** Is a webpage that displays list of Doctores with their biography from the back end api [Doctore-back-end](https://github.com/preciousbetine/microverse-final-capstone-project)

The goal of this project is to display the ability to implement a full stack web application by connecting the back end to the front end by creating a web service used by hospitals to allow clients/patients to book doctors from anywhere at their convenience
